I was born to illiterate parents and was 2nd of five children when we came to Mumbai from my village in the 5th standard. I used to stay with my parents in slums, selling vegetables on the footpath and sleeping there since the house could not accommodate all of us. We often went to sleep without a meal.
 <br><br class="desktop">
I came in contact with Our Children  for my English classes in Five Gardens and soon developed a liking for studies. My icons Ram and Dhananjay Sir encouraged me in studies and I started topping my school. The turning point was when Ram Sir took me to his house for studies and I stayed there for three years and completed my college to join medicine.
 <br><br class="desktop">
My goal was to study as much as possible and become a highly qualified and respectable citizen and stay connected always with Our Children. Our Children encouraged my liking for education and also developed my personality. The confidence and support given, made me pursue my dreams.

My childhood began in Bombay Vigilance for 12 years and then I completed my education from Seva Sadan. I still remember we used to wait for Children’s Meet on 1st May and Bal Mahostav organized by Our Children (OC). We got opportunities to show our skills, meet our friends and have outings.  I feel these programs have made lot of difference in life. It has improved my confidence, also developed public speaking skills.
<br><br class="desktop">
When I was studying social work, it was difficult for me to understand lectures in English. During this period Kalyani Didi from OC played a very important role in my life. She took English lessons, explained me the concept in local language, developed my vocabulary and that was the moment I felt that “I can” also communicate in English. While many volunteers used to come to our Ashram to conduct the various activities, it was OC which treated us as a family.
<br><br class="desktop">
Being an inmate of Seva Sadan and a Social Worker I dreamed of working with children living in child welfare institutions. For the past 15 years I am associated with OC because I feel it’s my own organization and I have to change many children’s life and bring them into the mainstream
<br><br class="desktop">
OC has been instrumental in bringing clarity and purpose in my life and having the courage to be an independent woman in today’s world</p>

          <p class="small text-center">My story with Our Children started many years ago in 1976 when I was in the 3rd Standard. My sister used to go to the free classes Ram Sir held in 5 Gardens and I started accompanying her. I used to go to classes in the evenings where we were played games, sang bhajans, listened to stories and did other fun activities along with studies. Eventually, I grew up and became a homemaker with a happy family and life continued as usual.  In 2010, I attended a reunion function and magically renewed my association with Our Children as a volunteer.
            <br><br class="desktop">
I volunteer for the learning beyond camps, bal mahotsav and the Children’s Meet Program. My son also volunteers with Our Children from time to time. I admire and am inspired by Ram Sir and Dhananjay Sir. While children learn from us and enjoy our company, volunteering has a similar impact on us. I learn a lot and spend time reminiscing my childhood.</p>

          <p class="small text-center">I first came in touch with Our Children in the year 2000 when I was in 10th grade. I used to go to Our Childrens Yuva Shakti meetings. We used to be trained on social skills, language, personal hygiene, manners etc. It made a big impact on me as a child. Now, I do part time activities like teaching sessions in schools and teaching arts and crafts to children. Throughout this journey I have continued my association with Our Children as a volunteer. In fact my husband also volunteers when he can.<br><br class="desktop">
I like working with and organizing large groups, so I volunteer at Learning Beyond and other residential camps. One of my favorite activities is co-compering the program on the 1st of May.  Volunteering gives me inner happiness.  It is an avenue of giving back what society has given to me. I feel that I can use my experience to guide children from these institutions since I have been through their journey. On a personal note, volunteering boosts my self-confidence.  When I compère in front of thousands of children, I take a lot from it and gain more self-esteem.</p>
