					<p class="small text-center">The sight of under privileged children begging for food prompted a group of young like-minded individuals to come together to alleviate their sufferings. The group joined a couple who had engaged themselves in collection and distribution of excess food from wedding parties. This spark lead to the formation of Our Children (OC) as an NGO in 1970, initially  with a focus on providing food to the underprivileged children. As the organisation evolved and grew, the impact expanded to education, life skills, talent development, mentoring,  following a very simple philosophy - Strive to provide as many opportunities as possible to as many children as possible, providing every child a chance to be a child.
<br>
With a core purpose of bringing love, happiness and identity into the lives of underprivileged children, Our Children today partners with over 35 Child Welfare Institutions in Mumbai to run developmental projects and activities. For over 47 years OC has been the bridge between a child in an institution and the outside world, opening up opportunities which enable children to grow, learn and succeed.
<br>
OC’s focus is not only on ensuring the provision of basic requirements in a child’s growth and welfare like education and health but creating extended impact which gives them independence and empowerment. Our approach is to address a child’s emotional and psychological needs, by being their extended family. Our programs provide a safe environment for children to learn and express themselves creatively and  act as a catalyst to discover, grow  and showcase talent.  Our enthusiastic volunteer team makes this happen by teaching, mentoring, bonding and inspiring them as role models.
<br>
We are a volunteer driven organization. A large number of our volunteers are grown-ups who got to know of OC from being in Child Welfare Institutions themselves. They are now successful doctors, lawyers and contributing members of society who believe that service to humanity is the best work of life.

          <p class="small text-center">It has been my honour to be associated with "Our Children". I had the privilege to be closely connected with such an esteemed forum and thank you for giving me this opportunity. "Our Children" has consistently, year after year, helped the youth and the less privileged children to showcase their talents, unleash their potentials and build their confidence. With great pride, I have seen children demonstrating their hidden talents. The value inculcated by the forum including the Spirit of Camaraderie and Teamwork are notable. I also would like to mention and the appreciate the efforts of the dedicated Staff and Volunteers who have been working timelessly to do commendable work. I have been witnessing all the events of 1st May since 1975 with my family and that too without fail. May the Almighty shower his Choicest Blessings to help nurture the pious mission that "Our Children" continues to strive for.</p>

          <p class="small text-center">The children of all institutions and staff members are very lucky to be associated with “OUR CHILDREN”.
<br>
Initially, “Our Children” started with 6 members and at present there are over 100 volunteers who are helping to organise different activities to develop future of children.When I think of “Our Children”, only one thing comes in my mind that is a ‘Huge Tree’ with deep strong roots, plenty of branches, fresh leaves and sweet fruits. Approximately, more than 4000 children are taking advantage of this “TREE”. All volunteers of this organisation are working selflessly for disadvantaged children inspite of their personal busy schedule. Their devotion to this organisation is most commendable.
<br>
 Through A.I. Islam’s A.D Bawla Female orphanage, children take part in children’s meet, overnight picnics and felicitation of successful students.They give their precious time to attend our functions whenever they are invited and grace the occasions. We all pray to the Almighty for the success of “Our Children” and for the well being of all the volunteers associated with “Our Children”.</p>
